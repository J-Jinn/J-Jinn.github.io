###### Static web-pages only: (look at the live hosted version in last section instead)
Note: cannot send/receive data via GET/POST since GitHub Pages only supports static sites.

Note: navigation bar visible and available only with working Flask web framework.

###### Link to Senior Project Flask Web App Hosted on PythonAnywhere.com
TODO - Flask Web App Hosting on Borg Supercomputer.

TODO - Re-write Python back-end to actually to run text prediction model and use output for visualization.

Flask functionality currently implemented works.
- POST user input to Flask and then GET that input back to demo.html to output on canvas.
- Various other experimentation with sending/receiving/importing data.

Note: Had to upgrade to monthly subscription paid account ($6.00) due to disk space requirements for all packages /sadface.
